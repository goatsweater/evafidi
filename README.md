# Electic Vehicle and Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Investments

The NRCan Electric Vehicle and Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Deployment Initiative [program page](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency-transportation-alternative-fuels/electric-and-alternative-fuel-infrastructure/electric-vehicle-alternative-fuels-infrastructure-deployment-initiative/18352) has information about infrastructure investments in public charging for electric vehicles, but unfortunately there is no associated dataset through the Government of Canada's open data portal.

# What is this project about?

I was interested in where the money was being spent, and thought this was a good opportunity to explore some tools and associated datasets to explore it.
